# Bitok Helper Addon

This add-on helps students to easily join virtual classes by adding a direct link on 
the virtual class list page. There will be no need to copy and paste the link.

Also the classes of the department of computer engineering are highlighted to be easily spotted.

The original version of the add-on has been developed by [Ali Rashidi](https://github.com/codenegaar)
